I'm trying to improve the connection between my Pixel and my Win10 PC when I connect with the C-to-A cable. The popup options thing does what it's supposed to (is there a way to set "transfer files" as the default?), but sometimes the computer loses the Pixel connection in my device list, and I have to unplug and replug it to get it to show up again. This is sub-optimal. So I found this: (http://www.technobuzz.net/do. Драйвера для Андроид устройств.

I still have yet to receive an OTA for Marshmallow, so I figured I would go ahead and delve into the sideload/ADB method for updates. Long story short is that I have everything installed related to the SDK and the manager tells me that the Google USB Driver was installed, but I can't for the life of me get the computer to recognize the device when it's in ADB mode. I even did the manual driver install and downloaded the separate zip file with the drivers but no matter Вам будут нужны две вещи для этого процесса: Android Debug Bridge, который представляет собой командную строку для ПК, с помощью которой можно общаться с телефоном, и USB драйвер для вашего устройства. Hi all my Xperia Play finally came in the post today after a long wait. I have a few questions please bear in mind that I am basically new this but I've tried to do some background reading in the past.

Apparently I am able to unlock the phone to use on a different network using O2 online for has anyone had any success with this? ~~I have tried to download Crash Bandicoot but it wont let me is it because

My 5X died on January of last year. I did everything to revive it and I could push its life a little longer. I decided to leave it for a while and I got a Pixel. Turns out I need the phone again and now it simply doesn’t turn on. Yesterday I got it into fast boot, but now I don’t even get the battery red light. What should. Порой полезно знать, как откатить прошивку Андроида до предыдущей версии. Эта операционная система регулярно получает обновления. I'm on an LG G3 D855P and most of the time, flashing through TWRP and Flashify fails and even when it doesn't fail, I get "Secure Boot Failed" and then a black screen with a blinking red and blue LED. I'm thinking I haven't properly unlocked my bootloader, but I don't know how I'd go about doing that. Any ideas on what I could. Прошивка и разблокировка модемов/телефонов Huawei, ZTE, Alcatel.

I've tried many different methods to unlock my phone and I've also deleted drivers and reinstalled them but nothing is working Hi, I'm trying to root my device, but before that I need to unlock bootloader. I followed the instructions on youtube, but again, something went wrong. I have enabled USB debugging, OEM unlocking, I installed USB drivers, I downloaded "Mi Unlock", got into Fastboot, but it still can not detect my phone. Some people said to extract the files into new folder directly on C:\. Still doesn't work. Can anyone help? My device is Redmi Note 5  Android version : 8.1.0 OPM1.171019.011. So I just replaced the battery in my Pixel. It died during an update (thought I'd bricked the thing at first!), so it's currently bootlooping. No ROM or recovery installed. I'm able to access the bootloader though. However, when I plug it into my computer (tested with two different computers and three different USB cables), it doesn't show up. Not at all. Doesn't just show up as "USB device" or "Mass Storage Device" or any of that - it doesn't show up at all. It's like I'm not plugging anything. 
I've searched a bit through posts here and saw someone saying this " I'm still not exactly sure of how to solve the problem but I've discovered something new: Xiaomi's unlocking tool only has a short time period - a handful of minutes - after Windows boots in which Xiaomi's unlocking tool will even detect the phone on my PC. It is within this time period that I've attempted to unlock the bootloader. After this short time period it will start throwing the "not connected to phone" error again TL;DR - I can't boot past the bootloader or get a recovery .img to stick using fastboot commands. I did something wrong when updating some Substratum overlays and my phone (unlocked, stock, unrooted) went into a bootloop. Using Nexus Root Toolkit has allowed me some control via fastboot, and I've got all the drivers/ADB stuff set up properly on my PC. I have downloaded current system images, TWRP, LineageOS zip, Magisk zip etc., so I'm good to go with a ROM or stock, as necessary. Hey guys. I've been trying to unlock the bootloader on my Mi Mix for a little while now, and I think there's something wrong. I've been unlocking my devices since my HTC Legend that required that hellish GoldCard (https://r3dux.org/2010/07/how-to-make-a-goldcard-and-root-a-htc-desire/) method of gaining root access, so I'm not entirely new to the process of unlocking a bootloader. I do however, seem to run unto some inconsistencies this time around. Firstly, I've been following the guides. Hey guys, thanks for reading. I'm a total newbie, I don't really know what I'm doing. I'd like to get my nexus out of BLOD tho, and I've found the xda fix, I even think I kind of understand how to do it (again, 0 experience). The wall I've run into is getting my computer to talk to the phone at all. I've got USB debugging enabled, manually set it to MTP, OEM unlocked, all of it. I hope. But when I connect the cable, the phone will charge but that's it. No notifications for changing USB setting. I'm trying to install the disable cores bootloader. (https://www.xda-developers.com/nexus-5x-bootloop-fix-boot-phone/) It requires the bootloader being unlocked. I went to developer options and ticked "Enable OEM Unlocking" and "USB Debugging", but when I entered recovery mode, it still says device status locked. 
Hi, I'm looking to unlock my Robin's bootloader and install LineageOS, but I have a question. The tutorial I'm using skips over a very important detail. The Robin is encrypted out of the box. Would this interfere with flashing TWRP Recovery, or am I wrong? Also, I'm fairly certain that in ADB, if you type "adb devices" and your device's serial number shows up, you have your USB drivers installed. I never manually installed the USB drivers for the Nextbit Robin Anyone else have this issue or solve this issue? If so, how did you solve. I have a OnePlus 3 (I think the version is Orea) and just downloaded updates. The updates seemed to have failed to install. On rebooting, I get 'dm-verity is not started.'. Any ideas on how to fix this? I don't know too much about Android and flashing devices and I'm a little lost. I found this post on XDA (https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-3t/how-to/fix-dm-verity-warning-flashing-required-t3546531) that showed a couple of commands to enter in fastboot mode. How/Where do I enter. I have always had the stock/unrooted/unlocked Android. Yesterday I got the untrusted OS error and had to unlock the bootloader, reflash the stock ROM (7.1.1), and relock the bootloader. Wow, the difference is amazing. Like a new phone. I had wiped cache and factory reset before, but nothing made a change like this. For those struggling to get a bit more life out of your N6, highly recommend this. Flashing is an easy process and Google makes restoring your previous setup fairly painless. 
i recently acquired a nvidia shield tablet off of ebay it came with 5.1.1 already rooted but i got it so i could load kali nethunter 3 and use it for school. Nethunter 3 only runs on marshmallow currently. I havent rooted anything since 2010 and i cannot seem to find much info on updating from 5.1.1 to marshmallow that is laid out for noobs like myself. I am humbly aski ng the root masters on this sub reddit for guidance. thank you in advance. Apart from some missing features everything is working Hi, i have Oneplus One , Cyanogen 13.1 version, and i'm using Windows 10 x64. i wish to root my phone which was never rooted before and i can't pass that simple stupid 1st step. So , i tried following all the guides, and tried to install different drivers .like Samsung, or Google.i tried using BaconRootKit to do it for me, and also failed. i use USBDeview to remove usb drivers before, i install the ADB driver, and after that, when i wish to update the driver manually Hi, how do I go back to stock MIUI on my Xiaomi Mi5? Bootloader is unlocked but MiFlash does not seem to be working. </p>
