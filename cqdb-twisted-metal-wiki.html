                            <p> Twisted Metal (рус. Искорёженный металл) — серия игр. Первая игра серии вышла в 1995 году и была исполнена в жанре битвы на автомобилях. Twisted Metal (рус.

In the mid 90's, I had this CD-ROM of 100 games called "Mega Pak" or something. Most of them were garbage or didn't work but there were some gems. "Syndicate Wars" and "Cyberdogs" were some good games I discovered from those discs. There was another game whose graphics I remember very distinctly but I forget the title. I remember lots of cars driving around a big arena and crashing, blowing each other up. One car was this bubbly yellow taxi. I'm picturing it in 3d but that may be wrong. PlayStation: Флаг США 31 октября 1996 · Флаг ЕС Февраль 1997 · Флаг Японии 28 августа  Twisted Metal 2 стала второй и последней игрой серии, которая появилась где-то кроме консолей Sony.

(WARNING: Includes spoiler endings for both TM 2012 and TMB if you haven't played either of them) Alright so I've been on a bit of a Twisted Metal Binge since I got Twisted Metal: Black on PS4 and I was thinking about it compared to the 2012 remake of Twisted Metal on PS3, and a thought came to mind: What if the events Twisted Metal Black came AFTER Sweet Tooth's Ending in Twisted Metal 2012? Here's some context which gives me my theory: Twisted Metal is a Tournament where

They are driving on the wrong side of a 2 lane highway at night and have a head on collision. Next shot is the driver being wheeled into a dark and dirty hospital where you are connected to something through a needle in the eye, I think. The gameplay is a third person 3d car combat game. Your car kind of mimics the 50s car from the cutscene. I remember the taillights.

Back in the early 2000's I've played this vehicle racing game on the Windows 98. I can only remember that it had Turbos, Gatling guns?, Rockets and a weird purple/pink thing that can be attached on the bumper of the car that emits electric shock. There were also different maps and different characters that you can play. If that was still vague, I can remember some of the loading screen where there was a girl with a Green jeep. ---> looks REALLY similar to this http://puu.sh/h2pjv/34cb9dec70.j. Пока весь мир с упоением давил педестрианов в Carmageddon, где-то в дебрях затерялся очень самобытный и милый проект Twisted Metal, абсолютно. I remember as a kid I played this game, I'm not sure if it was on Playstation 1 or 2, or on Xbox, but I remember playing it so much and you would spawn in a vehicle and there would be an arsenal of weapons on the map. The map would usually have jumps and such, but it would be enclosed and the objective was just a deathmatch (achieving a number of kills). The characters you played were usually a bit weird, and I'm sure there was "Chaotic" or "Chaos" in the title 
I can't remember much of it as being a 90's kid I wasn't allowed to play it but there was this game my uncle had which was an over the top violent top down shooter. I don't know if I'm mixing it up with something else but I think one of the characters in it was a clown. I really want to try and find a copy of it to play as it always looked like the coolest # COMPLEX UNIVERSES # Albion The great elven empires were shattered into remnants long ago, yet the elves remain.

At around the same time the City of London Police alerted nearby St Bartholomews Hospital (Barts) that "a tube train had hit the buffers", but there was no indication at that stage of the seriousness of the crash.
