Some long-standing problems with the virtual file system were fixed. Performance for large mod lists was greatly improved. There's honestly a lot more than can be summarized Hello! Welcome once again to Lonely Souls. Today the antagonists learn a bit more about humanity, those crazy creatures, and we see the arrival of one of our main characters. I'm trying to focus a bit more on showing rather than telling. If you see me stray from that goal, please call me out! It's more work, but it's really worth it. Edit: just a reminder that I will be posting chapters of Lonely Souls every Saturday. Beginning (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bi3b89/oclonely_souls_. I recently posted a thread titled "What leads a trans woman to think they are a woman?" I got a lot of interesting responses, which you can read here if you want: https://www.reddit.com/r/GCdebatesQT/comments/b9xith/what_leads_a_trans_woman_to_believe_they_are_a/ It seems to me that the various reasons why a trans woman thinks they are a woman can fit into two buckets: body dysphoria and social dysphoria. Body dysphoria includes unhappiness with the physical form and could range from "I never. Doki Doki Development Diary XX: Vive la Diary Title PART ONE: Hello and welcome for our 1st of April diary! I know what you’re thinking, with your little eye roll and the whip back of your hair. Yes, you are thinking this is some sort of joke. Well I don’t joke. Do you hear me? I will never joke, and if you fucking think just because I plan on eventually releasing this mod doesn’t mean I won’t waste valuable resources on a bunch of obscure nations that don’t matter, you’ll never. Why do you feel/think not believing/agreeing with these statements: “trans women are women, trans men are men, (and non-binary people are whatever they say they are)” is transphobic? (Long as context/explanatory post following, you can skip it if you wish) Context: I have seen a few comments here and there on this forum suggesting that not all QT posters who subscribe to the view that rejecting TWAW/TMAM is transphobic believe this is simply because it’s something that is indeed

Teach Recently a large database (https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/server/34) of discord posts from Identity Evropa, one of the largest white-supremacist and fascist organizations in America, was leaked and they have a fair amount to say about Trump, the Republican party, and getting involved in politics. A refrain I saw time and time again was that it's easier than ever to push a white supremacist message in politics by simply claiming to be a Trump Republican. Here are some examples:. 
One of the accusations that get that gets thrown at QT a lot is that they are narcissists. This seems to be true if you consider being overly concerned with controlling the way others perceive you as a component of narcissism. Many trans people expect us to completely alter the way in which we perceive or understand reality to fit their desires and whether or not our perceptions are true or false is irrelevant.

Hi r/GCdebatesQt, It’s my first time posting here ! I am asking this question because I just had a conversation with a trans person regarding dating preferences, and this is something that came up. The trans person was trying to explain to me that if a man sleeps with a woman with vagina, it shouldn’t matter to them if she’s trans or not or had ovaries or a uterus, because that’s not what the man sees. He doesn’t see ovaries or uterus, he just sees a vagina.

Teach I'm more interested in QTs thoughts on this, particularly trans women--but GCs are free to comment too. The mainstream trans-positive view on trans women's identity (you can apply this to trans men, but I'm not a trans man and can only speak to my experience as a trans woman) is "trans women are women", and I feel that's less validating and empowering as it seems from the surface.
